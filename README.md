**POPULATION SEGMENTATION BY AGE: A COMPREHENSIVE DISTRIBUTION OVERVIEW**


**1.Library Imports:**
The code imports essential libraries for data manipulation (pandas, numpy), data visualization (matplotlib), and machine learning (scikit-learn).

**2.Data Reading and Initial Exploration:**
A CSV file is read using pandas. The dataset is displayed with df.head() and its column names are checked.

**3.Creating a Categorical DataFrame**:
A custom dataset is created for population distribution across different age groups, which is visualized using a bar plot.

**4.Bar Plot:**
Visualizes the population distribution by age group.
Custom formatting, such as gridlines and bar colors, improves readability.

**5.Generating Continuous Data:**
A random dataset of 1000 ages is generated using a normal distribution (mean=50, std=15).
The values are clipped between 0 and 100 to ensure realistic age values.

**6.Histogram Plot:**
Visualizes the distribution of continuous age data.
Uses 20 bins and custom colors for better visualization.
**Key Objective:**
To demonstrate how to visualize categorical (bar plot) and continuous (histogram) variables in population data using custom datasets.
